description: Kernel primitives and system model for Splendor.
---

Splendor Kernel is a design-stage runtime concept for neuro-symbolic agent loops.
These notes reflect current intent; implementation awaits the initial push.

## Kernel loop

A self-managed agent loop coordinates planning, action, observation, and
reflection. Neural policies propose actions, while symbolic constraints and
planners gate execution.

## Core primitives

- **State registry** for canonical world and agent state.
- **Reward primitives** for shaping objectives across multi-step tasks.
- **Policy contracts** for constraints, permissions, and safety gates.
- **Execution budgets** for time, cost, and resource governance.
